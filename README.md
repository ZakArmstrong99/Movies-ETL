# Movies-ETL
The purpose of this project was to create a function that automates the ETL process for Amazing Prime's movie streaming platform. The data is pulled from wikipedia's movie data, Kaggle's movie data, and MovieLens rating csv. Using pandas and python functions, the data is transformed and merged. Once the transformation is finished, it then is uploaded to a postgreSQL database.
